Most of us have worked with each other for extended periods of time at different organization at different times.\n\nSimplePlan Media is all about doing great things in the simplest way possible. When we say simple, we don’t mean easy - anyone who has ever tried running a marathon knows what we mean.\n\nThat’s not it though! - what drives us every day is striving towards providing our clients with simple solutions to support their grand endeavors. At SimplePlanMedia, “silly” ideas are not laughed at or looked down upon. Instead, they are played with and shaped into amazing creations. And this is what separates us from several other digital agencies. We are not about traversing a known path ahead of all others; we are about carving a new path where others only see a roadblock.\n\nThis also means that we don’t limit ourselves to only what we excel in. Instead, we take up challenges in every niche ranging from web design to mobile app development as well as brand identity creation.",

We were a passionate bunch of tech wizards who ditched the cookie-cutter approach and worked with you to craft a website that's as unique as your brand (and hopefully, way funnier).\n\nThink of us as your website fairy godmothers (or godfathers; we were not picky). We don't just sprinkle digital dust and hope for the best. We listen to your dreams, understand your goals, and then unleash our geek powers to create a website that not only looks stunning but converts visitors into raving fans.\n\nBut wait, there's more! While we are busy weaving our web magic, we also like to keep things light and, well, geeky. We believe that happy geeks make better websites (and vice versa), so expect some humor, Star Wars references, and maybe even a friendly debate about the merits of single-malt scotch along the way.\n\nSo, whether you're a spunky startup or a seasoned SMB, if you're looking for a website that packs a punch (and maybe makes you chuckle), then look no further than Geek Initus. Well, help you achieve your online goals and have a blast doing it. Because let's face it, the internet is already serious enough.",

Web Wallah started as a dream between these two classmates when they were both in tenth grade. They were deeply fascinated by the digital world and eager to create technological solutions that fulfilled their passion and offered us an avenue to earn.\n\nThe journey of Web Wallah began with the perfect name after a lot of brainstorming, inspired by the popularity of \"Physics Wallah\" among our peers, and when our classmate suggested \"Web Wallah,\" it immediately resonated with us. With that, our journey took off as we registered our domain and started setting up the website.\n\nThen something unexpected happened that was COVID-19 which turned into a surprising boon for us. With schools closed and exams postponed, Mayank found himself with the rare opportunity to fully dedicate his time to nurturing Web Wallah. While Krishna took a temporary break to prepare for his NEET exams, Mayank took the reins of our venture, transitioning into a solopreneur.\n\nIn 2020, We secured our first client, Jiksha Pathology, marking the beginning of an enriching professional journey. This initial project, crafted with immense effort and dedication, set the tone for what Web Wallah was destined to become. Over the years, I have been fortunate to work on hundreds of websites, helping numerous clients enhance their digital presence.\n\nThen in the same year, Mayank also started his startups JNVST Prep and CSHUB to boost the ed-tech industry. Gradually, Mayank kept taking Web Wallah to the next level and in Dec 2023 Web Wallah was finally incorporated with the Government of India. And when we start doing much better then we expand our team with multiple roles.",

We leverage their branding, web development and marketing experience with Fortune 500 Companies and Iconic Brands to help Small to Midsized Businesses, Nonprofits and Startups stand out, look better and exponentially increase revenue.\n\n---\n\nA little back story. We used to work exclusively with Big Brands and Fortune 500 companies. A few years back, we produced a documentary called Kindness Is Contagious. A film all about being nice and the benefits of being nice. While filming, we worked with a lot of startups, health care organizations and nonprofits. People who made money making the world a better place. And we got jealous. We wanted to make money making the world a better place, too. So we decided to take the principles that made those big companies so successful and adapt them to small business, startups and nonprofits.\n\nThe challenge was to massively simplify the marketing process, not only because these organizations could not afford the endless revisions, countless studies and infinite strategy sessions, but it also made it better.\n\n---\n\nLastly, David Gaz, the founder of the Bureau of Small Projects, writes about Branding for Forbes Magazine, Newsweek, Fast Company and has spoken at Stanford University, The Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and at events all across the country.",

As a group of freelance web developers ourselves, we thought we could help.\n\nBut we didn’t charge anyone. Instead, we just asked them to mention us to their friends, or hire us for additional projects, if they liked our work.\n\nWe got such positive feedback from people, and so many started coming back for additional paid work later on (like advanced website customizations or SEO support), that we launched The Free Website Guys.\n\nTo date, we’ve built over 5,000 professional websites for people around the world and we quickly became the top rated website development agency.\n\n--\nTo see examples of websites we've helped build, visit https://thefreewebsiteguys.com/examples\n\nTo apply to our free website program, visit https://thefreewebsiteguys.com and click on any of the large green buttons on the page!",
